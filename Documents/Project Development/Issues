1) get rid of blue border for main image at larger screen sizes?
3) hover transforms jerky. need to add transition duration etc.

ABOUT
1) Slideshow doesn't hide overflow on top border - make row of horizontal images instead?
2) slideshow is not responsive - currently commented out

MUSIC
1) page a bit empty at the moment - maybe have a 'shop' element beneath album samples?



***WHAT'S NEW - whole page currently removed - content moved to index.html
4) big gap between footer and content on medium screen size***


BOOK
1) button on sign up form does weird grey fill after being clicked.


EVERYWHERE:
1) change sign up link in footer to white underline instead of pink color - for consistency
2) sign up modal needs to check for valid email address and have something for user to know it has worked.
3) sign up modal button need to get rid of weird darker green
4) social media icons need to be linked to actual pages and to open in new tab when clicked.
