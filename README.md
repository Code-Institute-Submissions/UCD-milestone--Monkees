# UCD Milestone Project - The Monkees static webpage
This is a front-end only webpage for a band called The Monkees for their fans and 
followers. It provides the latest information on the band, their upcoming shows,
samples of their music and links to external sites to buy tickets or merchandise.
It also allows fans to sign up to their newsletter or enquire about booking the band.

This webpage was created as part of Code Institute's Software Diploma. 


## UX
This website is predominantly for fans of the band and is designed to
provide all the information they might want in a single place. 
The following user stories were brainstormed during the planning process and 
informed decisions for particular sections of the site.

1) As a fan of the band I want to get the latest news / gig info so that I can buy tickets to the next show.
2) As a fan of the band I want to hear the latest music so I can keep up to date with their next album.
3) As a event planner I want to check availability and contact the band so that I can book them for an event.
4) As a member of the public I want to find out about the band and listen to some samples so that I can decide if I like the band.
5) As a venue I want to see the bands fanbase (i.e social presence) so that I can see if booking them for a 
venue would generate revenue.

During project development I also created some wireframes for my project. My initial wireframes changed after some feedback on
the dark color scheme and some changes in layout. The final layout is also slightly different as issues arose during development.
Both sets of wireframes have been included in These can be viewed under <link href="/Documents/Project Development/WireFrames" type="text/css" />.

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Feature 1 - Navigation bar
The navigation bar allows users to navigate the site by clicking on links to other pages or the sign up modal.
This collapses to a 'burger icon' dropdown menu in mobile screen sizes to reduce over crowding and improve user experience.
#### Feature 2 - Sign up to newsletter link 
The sign up link implements a modal in the same page when clicked on. This allows users to sign up to the band's email newsletter
by entering their email and pressing submit. The form checks for a valid email address before allowing submission.
This link is available in the fixed footer on large and medium screen sizes and moves to the fixed navigation at top of page in mobile.
to make it more visually pleasing and avoid over crowding in mobile view. 
The sign up link can also be accessed from the "Never miss the news again!" banner on the home page.
The link displays a white underline when hovered on (in all locations: nav,footer and main page) to indicate it is a link and for consistency.

A 'latest video' is embedded into the homepage which users can press play and pause on at any time to view

#### Feature 4 - Large hero image with 'Book the band' title and link to book page
This feature is emphasised on the home page with its large and constrasting background image. The link itself bolds (font weight increases)
when hovered over to indicate it is a link. This link will take the user to the book page in the same browser window where they
can fill out the query form or check the calendar for the band's availability.

#### Feature 5 - Social media links in footer
The fixed footer displays links to facebook, twitter and youtube channels for the band. The icons are from FontAwesome and change 
color when hovered over to indicate they are a link.
These icons remain to the right of the footer on larger screen sizes and move to the center for prominence in mobile view.
****
When clicked on these links take the user to external social media sites in a new tab.

This form allows users to submit a query by filling out the email, contact number and query fields and submit their enquiry.

This is a calendar created with HTML and CSS. It is not currently interactive and the two month view merely allows users to check
if the band is available on certain dates (as unavailable dates are blocked out in contrasting pink colour).
