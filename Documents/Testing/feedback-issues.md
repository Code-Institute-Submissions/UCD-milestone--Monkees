# Issues and resolutions arising from feedback from friends and family
## Transition of images in carousel is too fast - can be distracting
## Font on about page particularly is too small to read easily (especially on larger screens - formatting looks off)
-Fixed 18/12/18, increased font size on main pages and decreased font weight for better readability
## Colour scheme is a bit bright
## Audio control at bottom in mobile view is covered by footer - can't access / play audio
-Fixed 18/12/18 wrapped last audio in div and added padding to div
## Left and Right controls not working for carousel of images.
-Fixed 18/12/18 id's not set properly for carousel - now working on all browsers.
