# Issues and resolutions arising from feedback from friends and family
## Transition of images in carousel is too fast - can be distracting
## Font on about page particularly is too small to read easily (especially on larger screens - formatting looks off)
## Colour scheme is a bit bright
## Audio control at bottom in mobile view is covered by footer - can't access / play audio
## Left and Right controls not working for carousel of images.
