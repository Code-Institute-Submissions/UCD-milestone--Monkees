            <h1>The Monkees</h1>
            <p>The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally formed in 1965 in Los Angeles. Band members Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, Peter Tork and Davy Jones created "The Monkees" as part of a television series of the same name that first
                aired in 1966. The band eventually broke away from the studio and became successful in their own right. The band continues to perform and tour though Davy Jones passed away in 2012.

                production of "Oliver" changed his ambitions and he began to pursue a career in show business. Davy Jones joined The Monkees in 1966 and sang lead on many of their greatest hits, including "Daydream Believer". He passed away in February
                2012 in Florida.</p>

                however by the end of the series he was able to perform well live. He sings lead vocals on "I'm a believer" and "Last train to Clarkesville".</p>
